4. Is the world-wide web a category in any sense? Are links morphisms?

	1. Web Pages link to other web pages
	2. However do not compose, A -> B AND B -> C, does not mean there is a direct link between A -> C
	2. Web Pages can link to itself, however not sure if all web pages have a self link
	So, NO

	However, specialized software / humans can create virtual links that compose.

5. Is Facebook a category, with people as objects and friendships as morphisms?

	1. A ---friend--> B
	2. friendships do not compose, A -> B AND B -> C does not mean A -> C
	2. A cannot be friends with self, hence no identity morphism
	So, NO

	special friend-of-friends morphism can get around the do not compose restriction.

6. When is a directed graph a category?

	directed graph implies, arrow(edge) between 2 objects(nodes)

	Conditions to be met for directed graph to be a Category:
	1. if arrows compose, A -> B AND B -> C => A -> C is present
	2. if arrow between self to self exists for every object
